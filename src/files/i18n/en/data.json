        "guide": "1. What is TinyPilot?\n\nTinyPilot is a natural language based super agent that helps you analyze Based tokens and wallets, manage funds, and execute onchain trades — all via chat inside Telegram.\n\n 2. Is TinyPilot safe to use?\n\nTinyPilot uses custodial wallets for trading. While the system is secure, never share your private key. Currently, TinyPilot is in alpha; it might crash or provide incorrect data. Always DYOR (Do Your Own Research), store securely your private key and use small amounts at first.\n\n 3. What networks are supported?\n\nOnly the Base network is supported for now.\n\n 4. What can I do with TinyPilot?\n\n- Analyze token and wallet data\n- Create and manage a trader wallet\n- Deposit, withdraw, and send funds\n- Buy, sell, and swap tokens\n- Invite others via referral links and earn rewards\n\n 5. How do I get started?\n\nUse `/create_wallet` to generate your unique custodial trader wallet. Without a wallet, you can't place trade orders — but you can still analyze tokens and wallets.\n\n 6. Can I have more than one wallet?\n\nNo. Each Telegram user can only have one wallet. Re-creation is not allowed yet.\n\n 7. Do I need to use commands all the time?\n\nEach command unlocks a different mode that activates specific data access. \nFor example: \n`/start` allows you to integrate the bot and access the quick menu.\n`/create_wallet`  allows you to create a new wallet if you haven’t already.\n`/my_wallet` allows you to access your wallet address and private key.\n`/my_portfolio` allows you to access the assets you hold in your wallet.\n`/manage_wallet` allows you to perform deposit and withdraw transactions.\n`/token_data` allows you to access detailed insights about the token based on the ticker or contract address you provide.\n`/execute_trades` allows you to buy, sell, and swap tokens.\n`/wallet_data` allows you to access detailed information about the ENS name, wallet address, or Farcaster username you provide.\n`/my_referral` allows you to access the usage statistics of your referral link.\n`/security_check` allows you to access a detailed security analysis of any token ticker or contract address you provide.\n\n 8. Where can I find my wallet address or my wallet’s private key?\n\nUse the /my_wallet command to view your address and its private key..\n\n 9. Can I view my wallet’s transaction history?\n\nYes. Use `/my_wallet` command. You'll get the BaseScan link of your wallet.\n\n 10. How can I deposit funds into my wallet?\n\nUse `/my_wallet` to receive your deposit address. We recommend depositing ETH to cover network fees.\n\n 11. Can I send tokens to others?\n\nYes. You can send tokens to:\n\n- Wallet address (e.g., `0x123...456`)\n- ENS name (e.g., `tinylabs.eth`)\n- Farcaster username (e.g., `yourfriend`)\n- Telegram username (e.g., `@yourfriend`)\n\n 12. Can I withdraw my funds?\n\nYes. You can withdraw at any time. A quick reminder that TinyPilot does not support cross-chain transfers.\n\n 13. What token-related questions can I ask?\n\n- “What is $TOKEN’s price?”\n- “Show $TOKEN’s MCAP, FDV, and liquidity.”\n- “How did $TOKEN perform in the last 24h?”\n- “Who are the top 10 holders of $TOKEN?”\n- “What’s $TOKEN’s Uniswap/GeckoTerminal link?”\n\n 14. What wallet-related questions can I ask?\n\n- “Does jessepollak.eth hold $TOKEN?”\n- “Show sencrazy.eth’s top trades this week.”\n- “What’s the portfolio value of 0x123…45?”\n\n 15. How do I buy tokens?\n\nUse `/execute_trades` and say:\n\n- “Buy 100 $TOKEN”\n- “Buy $100 worth of $TOKEN”\n- “Buy $TOKEN with 25% of my ETH”\n\n 16. How do I sell tokens?\n\nUse `/execute_trades` and say:\n\n- “Sell 100 $TOKEN”\n- “Sell $TOKEN worth $50”\n\n 17. How do I swap tokens?\n\nUse `/execute_trades` and say:\n\n- “Swap 100 $TOKENA to $TOKENB”\n- “Swap 50% of my $TOKEN to $TOKENB”\n\n 18. How do referrals work?\n\nEach user has a unique invite link. When someone joins via your link:\n\n- You earn 30% of their trading fees\n- They get a 10% fee discount (1% → 0.9%)\n\n 19. What’s the reward breakdown?\n\n- Fren 1: 30%\n- Fren 2: 4%\n- Fren 3: 3%\n- Fren 4: 2%\n- Fren 5: 1%\n\n 20. Can I change my referral code?\n\nNo. Once set, your referral code is permanent.\n\n 21. What’s the minimum reward I need to claim referral earnings?\n\nMinimum claimable reward is `0.1 WETH`.\n\n 22. Which 3rd party data providers does TinyPilot use?\n\n- CoinGecko\n- Birdeye\n- Moralis\n- Neynar\n- ClankFun\n\n 23. I encountered an error. What should I do?\n\nRetry later, and if you continue to experience the same issue, contact support through the TinyLabs community: https://t.me/tinylabscommunity\n\n 24. Can I use TinyPilot in my group chat?\n\nYes! TinyPilot works in group chats as well as DMs. In groups, it can respond to queries using the same command system. However, TinyPilot has limited features for group chat usage.\n\n 25. Can I add TinyPilot in my group chat?\n\nAbsolutely. Add the bot like any other Telegram bot.\n\n 26. Who has access to my Trader Wallet?\n\nOnly you have access to your Trader Wallet. The wallet is created and mapped to your Telegram ID. No one else can access it unless you share your private key. Your private keys are encrypted and stored securely.\n\n 27. Where is my private key stored?\n\nThe private key is securely encrypted and is only shared with you if explicitly requested.\n\n 28. What happens if I delete the bot or clear chat?\n\nYour wallet remains intact and recoverable via your Telegram account. Deleting chat history does not delete your wallet or data.\n\n 29. What happens if I delete or lost my Telegram account?\n\nYour wallet remains intact and recoverable via your Telegram account. Deleting or losing your Telegram account will cut off access to your wallet. That’s why we suggest revealing your private key and storing it securely to maintain access to your wallet without TinyPilot.\n\n 30. Why is my trade/query taking longer than expected?\n\nThis may occur due to Base network congestion or gas fluctuations. All transactions or queries go through validation, signature, submission, and confirmation steps.\n\n 31. Does TinyPilot support other languages?\n\nCurrently, English is the default supported language. More language support will be introduced in future versions.\n\n 32. How can I follow product updates? Are there any official social links for the project?\n\nTinyPilot is built by TinyLabs. TinyLabs is a venture studio that builds on-chain AI products. Here are our official links where you can reach us or follow to stay updated:\n\nX: https://x.com/0xtinylabs \n\nTelegram: https://t.me/tinylabscommunity \n\nFarcaster: https://warpcast.com/tinylabs",
